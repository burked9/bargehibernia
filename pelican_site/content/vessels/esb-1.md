The ESB (Electricity Supply Board) Civil Works Plant Specification Sheet from 1932 indicates she is 18.03m (58.6ft) in length with a width of 4.22m (13.7ft) and a height of 1.4m (4.6ft). She has 6mm steel sides with a flat bottom constructed of timber and had a capacity of 51 tonnes.

Originally commissioned by Siemens for the construction of the Ardnacrusha Hydroelectric Station, ESB 1 was one of two German-built steel barges brought to Ireland in 1924 along with ESB 2. The two boats are unique in that they were the only steel boats to work on the Irish waterways that had timber bottoms. When the building of Ardnacrusha was complete in 1932, both boats were purchased by the ESB for the price of £200 each.

They were used by the ESB Maintenance department as dumb barges (without engines) and were towed around by the ESB tugboat to various projects. These included carrying materials up and down the tailrace to grouting operations, to drilling operations and concrete plating maintenance. 

Most notably, ESB 1 played a lead role in the dramatic 1963 recovery of 62M—an abandoned cement barge submerged for over two years after CIE and ESB haggled over whose problem it was. She had sunk with a load of cement while being towed by the St. Patrick two years previously. Together with ESB 2, she formed the cradle between which 62M was lifted from the tailrace. It’s said CIE's John Dunn retrieved his purse (containing £90) from the cabin once the vessel was raised. The ESB engineering drawings for the salvage operation are an interesting read.

Unlike ESB 2, she had her cargo hold covered over with timber to make a solid working platform. By 2001, ESB 1 lay outside the ESB depot in Killaloe with a leaking timber bottom and tired hull, being pumped out every couple of weeks. Bought by Gerry Burke, she was nearly towed to Lough Derg by 68M on April 8th before floods in the disused canal overwhelmed the attempt. Only with the added help of Joe Tracey (4E) and a Jeep was the rescue mission salvaged. She now rests in soft mud, partly submerged—still waiting for her next chapter and a long deserved makeover.
