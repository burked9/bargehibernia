The ESB (Electricity Supply Board) Civil Works Plant Specification Sheet from 1932 indicates she is 18.04m (58.6ft) in length with a width of 4.2m (13.7ft) and a height of 1.4m (4.6ft). She has 6mm steel sides with a flat bottom constructed of timber and had a capacity of 53 tonnes.
 
Both ESB 1 and ESB 2 were built in Germany by Ziegret Boizenbarg in 1924. ESB 2 joined her sister in Ireland in 1924 to support Siemens on the Ardnacrusha hydroelectric project. Like ESB 1, she was sold to the ESB in 1932 and became a workhorse on the Shannon system for decades.

They were used by the ESB Maintenance department as dumb barges (without engines) and were towed around by the ESB tugboat to various projects. These included carrying materials up and down the tailrace to grouting operations, to drilling operations and concrete plating maintenance.

In 1963, ESB 2 helped execute one of the more ingenious salvage operations in Irish waters. Alongside ESB 1, she flanked and winched up 62M—sunken after CIE relinquished ownership. The operation not only removed a navigational hazard but cemented (quite literally) both dumb barges as crucial work vessels in the ESB's maintenance fleet.

Her own journey turned upside down—literally—when craned out for bottom repairs in the early 1990s, only to be abandoned for years. By 2001, she was lying inverted at the pier head in Killaloe. Purchased by Gerry Burke, she got a new steel bottom welded on by Patrick Minogue. Her re-righting in May 2002 made a splash—slipping from the crane and busting a fence (which cost more to fix than the crane hire). But she returned to the water, towed by 68M to rejoin her sister.

In September 2004, to celebrate Water Heritage Day, the Burke gang took ESB 2 to Dromineer with 68M to collect 1000 bales of barley straw, which was then brought across the lake to Dromaan. ESB 2 is now patiently awaiting a spurt of energy from her owner to start its conversion, which is due any day soon.
