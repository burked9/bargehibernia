Meet the 68M was one of a series of purpose-built “M” type motorised boats, purchased by the Grand Canal Company (GCC) in the late 1920s. She was transferred to Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ) in 1946 when the State’s transport system was nationalised.

Ten years later, when commercial carrying ceased on the canal, 68M was laid up, but was kept by CIÉ and used for maintenance work. She was laid up in 1980. All boats remaining in the ownership of CIÉ, 68M was subsequently transferred to the Office of Public Works and became part of a re-engineering boom, but this distinct group are now largely forgotten.
