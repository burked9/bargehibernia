## About Us

### Our Mission
**Preserving the floating heritage of Ireland's inland waterways, one vessel at a time.**

Just as every shift matters in the world of work, every story matters in the world of heritage. We are dedicated to documenting, restoring, and celebrating the unique history of the Barge Hibernia and her sister vessels.

### Our Vision
**Thriving waterways in every community.**

We believe that our inland waterways are more than just transport routes; they are living communities. Our goal is to ensure these historic vessels remain a vibrant part of that landscape, connected and trusted by enthusiasts worldwide.

### Our Values

*   **Listen to History**
    We seek diverse stories, perspectives, and experiences from those who worked and lived on these boats. No one person has all the answers, and listening is how we preserve the truth.

*   **Restore with Integrity**
    The original craftsmanship matters. We are passionate about showing up, with intention, to honor the past while securing the future.

*   **Stronger Together**
    Our community succeeds with mutual respect and collaboration. Whether you are a boat owner, a historian, or an enthusiast, we all have a key part to play in building the HBA legacy.

*   **Own the Journey**
    We take the lead in preservation. We own our results, celebrate the milestones (like re-floating a sunken barge!), and are constantly learning.
