## Hibernia: A Legacy on Water

Built in 1912 by the renowned Portadown Foundry, Hibernia is more than just a vessel—she is a story, a floating testament to Ireland’s maritime heritage. At 63 feet long and 15 feet wide, she once worked the waters of the Lagan, but soon transformed into one of Ireland’s earliest full barge conversions, setting a precedent for luxury afloat.

With polished cut-glass doghouses, a steel superstructure fitted with elegant portholes, and an interior adorned with tiled floors and a grand fireplace, Hibernia was built to enchant. In the 1940s and 1950s, she was known as a floating palace, offering warmth, refinement, and timeless character.

Today, Hibernia continues to capture hearts. Whether you seek her history, her charm, or simply a glimpse into Ireland’s past, she remains a testament to craftsmanship, vision, and the enduring romance of life on the water.
