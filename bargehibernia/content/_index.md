## Hibernia: A Legacy on Water
*A Legacy in Motion*

Built in 1912, Hibernia is more than just a vessel—she is a living testament to Ireland’s maritime heritage. From her origins as a hard-working Lagan barge to one of Ireland’s first full barge conversions, she has sailed through history with an undeniable spirit of resilience.

Through decades of transformation, sinking and salvage, storms and restoration, Hibernia has endured—a floating masterpiece, lovingly rebuilt by hands that refuse to let her story fade. Now, standing proudly once more, she continues her journey towards a new era.

Explore her past, witness her revival, and become part of the legacy.
