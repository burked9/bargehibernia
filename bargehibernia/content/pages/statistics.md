These figures reflect a combination of curiosity, nostalgia, and technical interest—showcasing everything from working cargo barges to converted liveaboards and historical wrecks.

*Tip:* You could later cross-tabulate this by builder (e.g., Portadown vs Dublin), by vessel prefix (M-, B-, E-, etc.), or by vessel status (e.g., active, sunk, remains, restored).
