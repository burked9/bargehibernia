Built by the Portadown Foundry in 1912, she is 63ft long by 15ft wide. It is believed that she worked on the Lagan for approximately four years as this is the only record found. It was then purchased by a local businessman who converted it to a pleasure craft.
While it wasn't unusual for people to live in old barges, the Hibernia was probably the earliest full barge conversion in Ireland.  
At the time of her conversion no expense was spared, her side decks were removed and a new steel superstructure was then fitted to extend up the sides by over 30". This new superstructure was then fitted with portholes.
The top deck was covered with wood and fitted out with a number of doghouses with cut glass. Inside she had concrete floors that were tiled and had a fireplace and domestic plumbing features such as a bath. It is understood from people that remember her back in the 1940's and 1950's that she was fitted out like a palace. 
It was moved to just below the Ml motorway bridge on the upper Bann in 1964 where it was later vandalised and eventually sank. It remained submerged until it was re-floated in 2003.
Many years before her salvage, a previous owner (it had at least two previous owners) spotted her from the Motorway bridge. After getting bitten by the barge bug while spending time on converted barges on the Shannon, he started to look for a hull to convert. Eventually he remembered the Hibernia, full of mud on the banks of the Bann. He tracked down her owner and the deal was done.
It took lots of hands and a number of months to remove the tens of tonnes of mud from her. During this time she was effectively known as the "Mud Bucket". Eventually Hibernia re-floated herself! One night during heavy rainfall when the suction of the mud under her hull let go, she slipped her mooring and took off down river.

Later the next day it was discovered she had escaped and was eventually found one mile downstream resting against the bank. She was towed by "Naomi" the boat belonging to Mick Savage to the Battery Harbour which was the only available safe mooring for a craft of that size, the remaining mud and debris was removed over a period of months. She remained there for a couple of years before she was towed across the Lough to Toome where she was lifted out and brought up on to the bank to be re converted over the following six years. Hibernia's conversion isn't fully complete but she is once again back in the water and waiting patiently to lead the fleet from Lough Neagh to the Erne when the Ulster Canal eventually opens.
Her original engine was a Bolinder, later on an 11 litre AEC Mandator engine. She is now fitted with
new Perkins 6354 and has a Perkins 4108 wing engine. She is also fitted with a 15hp Bowthruster, a 6kW generator and a 3kW inverter.
In the Autumn of 2018, Hibernia (HI - BERNIA) was transported by road from Lough Neagh to Portaneena (Lough Ree) for re-design and construction works for the new owner.
