## GCC Barge 45M
The Irish barge 45M, was built in Dublin in 1928 by Vickers Ireland Limited, for the Grand Canal Company. She was constructed of riveted steel and motorized with a 15hp Bolinder E Type. On December 1st 1946, on Lough Derg between Portroe and Killaloe, in gale force conditions, 45M sank. See HBA Vessels: 45M
However, twenty-nine years later, in 1975, Donnacha Kennedy in an epic enterprise over a three month period, floated her again, ably assisted by spectators, family, friends, fellow boaters and divers and ninety barrels. Here he describes how it all came about. The photographs were taken by Sean Curtin.

**Coming soon:** content for this memory post is being prepared.  
This entry commemorates the 40th anniversary of the raising of 45M—a pivotal moment in barge restoration history.
