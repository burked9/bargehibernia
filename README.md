## Hibernia

Built by the Portadown Foundry in 1912, she is 63ft long by 15ft wide. It is believed that she worked on the Lagan for approximately four years as this is the only record found. It was then purchased by a local businessman who converted it to a pleasure craft.
While it wasn't unusual for people to live in old barges, the Hibernia was probably the earliest full barge conversion in Ireland.  
At the time of her conversion no expense was spared, her side decks were removed and a new steel superstructure was then fitted to extend up the sides by over 30". This new superstructure was then fitted with portholes.
The top deck was covered with wood and fitted out with a number of doghouses with cut glass. Inside she had concrete floors that were tiled and had a fireplace and domestic plumbing features such as a bath. It is understood from people that remember her back in the 1940's and 1950's that she was fitted out like a palace.

## Hibernia: A Legacy on Water

Built in 1912 by the renowned Portadown Foundry, Hibernia is more than just a vessel—she is a story, a floating testament to Ireland’s maritime heritage. At 63 feet long and 15 feet wide, she once worked the waters of the Lagan, but soon transformed into one of Ireland’s earliest full barge conversions, setting a precedent for luxury afloat.

With polished cut-glass doghouses, a steel superstructure fitted with elegant portholes, and an interior adorned with tiled floors and a grand fireplace, Hibernia was built to enchant. In the 1940s and 1950s, she was known as a floating palace, offering warmth, refinement, and timeless character.

Today, Hibernia continues to capture hearts. Whether you seek her history, her charm, or simply a glimpse into Ireland’s past, she remains a testament to craftsmanship, vision, and the enduring romance of life on the water.
